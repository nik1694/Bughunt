                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>Bug Hunt is a process where tracker issues are screened and prioritised. Hunt should help ensure we appropriately manage all reported issues - bugs as well as improvements and feature requests.</p>
                <p>The "Triage" is a French medical term, which originates from the verb Trier. The meaning of this term is to separate, select and sort. In the context of Software testing, it is used to define the severity and priority for new defects and is suitable for only large projects where large number of major defects come into the picture. </p>

                <h2>Bugs</h2>
                <p>Bugs in code that controls the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for patient deaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1 billion prototype Ariane 5 rocket had to be destroyed less than a minute after launch due to a bug in the on-board guidance computer program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly convinced a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine control computer.[.</p>

                <h2>Rework Cost</h2>
                <p>Fixing software defects, particularly those created by changing requirements, drives up the cost of Agile software development projects, according to a new survey by voke inc. Respondents reported software project increases of $3.2 million in 2008 to $3.4 million in 2012. Overall, the survey revealed that Agile is delivering increased customer satisfaction for more than 40% of companies but isn't doing as well on making development less expensive.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made in either a program's source code or its design, or in components and operating systems used by such programs. A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be buggy (defective)..</p>
